# Data Files for Onde Usar IA

This workflow uses two external datasets for AI capability scoring. The workflow **works without them** (falls back to model estimation), but scores are more accurate with the data.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd data/
./download.sh
```

Or download manually following the instructions below.

## Dataset 1: Anthropic Economic Index (AEI)

Source: [Anthropic/EconomicIndex on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/EconomicIndex)
License: CC-BY
Paper: [Which Economic Tasks are Performed with AI?](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/2e23255f1e84ca97/original/Economic_Tasks_AI_Paper.pdf)

### Required files

| File | Source | Size | What it contains |
|------|--------|------|------------------|
| `onet_task_statements.csv` | HuggingFace (release_2025_02_10/) | ~3.4 MB | Task descriptions per O*NET occupation |
| `onet_task_mappings.csv` | HuggingFace (release_2025_02_10/) | ~450 KB | % of Claude conversations per task |

### Download

```bash
# O*NET task statements (occupation → tasks)
curl -L -o onet_task_statements.csv \
  "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/EconomicIndex/raw/main/release_2025_02_10/onet_task_statements.csv"

# O*NET task mappings (task → % conversations)
curl -L -o onet_task_mappings.csv \
  "https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/EconomicIndex/raw/main/release_2025_02_10/onet_task_mappings.csv"
```

### Derived files (generated by the workflow)

These files are generated on first use if you have the raw data above:

| File | What it contains |
|------|------------------|
| `v4_task_ai_scores_lookup.json` | Pre-computed AI scores per task (keyed lowercase) |
| `occupation_ai_summary.json` | Average/max AI usage per occupation |

To generate them, run the workflow and it will process the CSVs into the lookup JSONs. Alternatively, ask G4 OS: "Process the AEI data into lookup files."

## Dataset 2: GDPVal (Optional)

Source: [OpenAI GDP Validation dataset](https://github.com/openai/evals)
License: MIT

| File | Size | What it contains |
|------|------|------------------|
| `gdpval/gdpval_prompts.json` | ~1.7 MB | 220 real professional prompts across 44 occupations |

This dataset is used to enrich the prompt-building guide with real-world examples. The workflow works fine without it — the knowledge file `prompt-building-guide.md` already contains all the examples.

## File Structure After Setup

```

├── download.sh                      # Download script

├── v4_task_ai_scores_lookup.json    # Generated: AI scores per task

    └── gdpval_prompts.json          # 220 professional prompts
```

## Without Data Files

If you don't download the data files, the workflow will:
1. Use model knowledge to estimate AI capability scores (marked as "estimativa")
2. Skip data-driven lookups
3. Still produce a complete diagnostic — just with lower confidence scores

The scoring guide (`knowledge/scoring-guide.md`) documents exactly how estimation works without data.
